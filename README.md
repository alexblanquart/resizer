# resizer

Simple command line tool to resize images with special arguments:
1. location of original images
2. location of resized images
3. width for resized images
4. heigth for resized images 

This is a mainly a wrapper around the awesome golang library https://github.com/nfnt/resize, that makes possible to avoid to use ImageMagick, but only for JPEG images for now!
